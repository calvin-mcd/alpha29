alpha29 (or mini planck) is a riff on the amazing [alpha28](https://github.com/PyrooL/Alpha) by PyrooL. This project was more of an exercise and is consider finished.

##RGB

Because this board uses a rp2040, you will need to use a logic shifter to utilise the rgb breakout. Something like [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/retired---using-the-logic-level-converter) or [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bi-directional-logic-level-converter-hookup-guide) for example.

## Todo
